INTRODUCTION                                      *auto-autoread-introduction*

Automatically read files when they've changed, This does what 'autoread'
promises to do but doesn't do. This plugin requires |+python| or |+python3|.

This is different from the built-in 'autoread' option in that it periodically
checks if the file on the disk has changed, which is _not_ what 'autoread'
does. 'autoread' only checks if the file is changed on when certain events
occur. To be more precise, when:

    - |:checktime| is used;
    - a buffer is entered;
    - |:diffupdate| is used;
    - |:e| is issued for a file that already has a buffer;
    - executing an external command with |!|;
    - returning to the foreground (^Z, fg, only if the shell has job control).

And for gVim, this is also done when:

    - closing the "right-click" menu (either by selecting something, or just
      by closing it);
    - focus is changed (this is what you already noticed);
    - closing the file browsers dialog that pops up if you use "file -> open",
      "file -> save as" from the menu (as well as some other places).

As you can see, this set is very limited. If you're running Vim in another
window while you're doing something else somewhere else, the buffer never gets
updated.

COMMANDS                                              *auto-autoread-commands*

:Autoread [N]                                                      *:Autoread*
                Start checking if the file belonging to the currrent buffer is
                changed. The file will be checked every {N} seconds. If {N} is
                not given, a value of {5} is used.

                This sets the *b:auto_autoread* variable to {N}, which can be
                modified to change the interval. If you set this to {0} we
                will stop (you will have to call |:Autoread| again to start).

:AutoreadStop                                                  *:AutoreadStop*
                Stop checking if the file belonging to the current buffer is
                changed. You do _not_ get a error if |:Autoread| is not
                active.
